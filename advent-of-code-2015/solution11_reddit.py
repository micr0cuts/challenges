    Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters,
        like abc, bcd, cde, and so on, up to xyz.
        They cannot skip letters; abd doesn't count.
    Passwords may not contain the letters i, o, or l, as these letters can
        be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.
    Passwords must contain at least two pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or zz.
